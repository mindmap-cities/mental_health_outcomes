# Anxiety subdomain

### **Variable label**:  Anxiety symptom score measured by the Hospital Anxiety & Depression Scale - Anxiety subscale (HADS-A) 
**Variable name**:   psy_anxiety_score_0  
**Variable description**:  Anxiety symptom score ranging from 0 to 21.  
**Value type**:  integer  
**Variable unit**:  score  
**Category coding**:  N/A  
 
**Harmonization status**: complete    
**Harmonization comment**:  The HADS-A anxiety scores (0-21) were calculated for participants with data on at least 6 items (out of a possible 7). If 1 item was missed, scores on the completed items were summed and divided by 6, then multiplied by 7. If participants missed 2 or more items, scores were not calculated and coded as missing. Items comprising the *Hospital Anxiety and Depression - Anxiety Subscale (HADS-A)* are listed below:  
1. I feel tense or 'wound up'.   
2. I get a sort of frightened feeling as if something awful is about to happen.     
3. Worrying thoughts go through my mind.    
4. I can sit at ease and feel relaxed.   
5. I get a sort of frightened feeling like 'butterflies' in the stomach.    
6. I feel restless as if I have to be on the move.   
7. I get sudden feelings of panic.  
Responses ranged from 'rarely or never' (0), 'some of the time' (1), 'occasionally' (2) to 'mostly or always' (3).  

**R script**:  
Responses for items 1-3 and 5-7 were kept as is.

### **Variable label**:  Anxiety symptom score measured by the Hospital Anxiety & Depression Scale - Anxiety subscale (HADS-A)   
**Variable name**:   psy_anxiety_score_4  
**Variable description**:  Anxiety symptom score ranging from 0 to 21.  
**Value type**:  integer  
**Variable unit**:  score  
**Category coding**:  N/A  
 
**Harmonization status**: complete    
**Harmonization comment**:  The HADS-A anxiety scores (0-21) were calculated for participants with data on at least 6 items (out of a possible 7). If 1 item was missed, scores on the completed items were summed and divided by 6, then multiplied by 7. If participants missed 2 or more items, scores were not calculated and coded as missing. Items comprising the *Hospital Anxiety and Depression - Anxiety Subscale (HADS-A)* are listed below:        
1. I feel tense or 'wound up'.   
2. I get a sort of frightened feeling as if something awful is about to happen.     
3. Worrying thoughts go through my mind.    
4. I can sit at ease and feel relaxed.   
5. I get a sort of frightened feeling like 'butterflies' in the stomach.    
6. I feel restless as if I have to be on the move.   
7. I get sudden feelings of panic.  
Responses ranged from 'rarely or never' (0), 'some of the time' (1), 'occasionally' (2) to 'mostly or always' (3).

**Harmonization comment**:  The CES-D 20 depression scores (0-60) in LASA were grouped into study-specific tertiles defined as low (0-3), medium (4-9), and high (10-60). Scores were calculated for participants with data on at least 16 items (out of a possible 20). If 1 or more items were missing, scores on the completed items were summed and divided by the number of items completed, then multiplied by 20. If participants missed 5 or more items, scores were not calculated and coded as missing. Items comprising the *Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, 20 item version*, are listed below.
*Below is a list of the ways you might have felt or behaved. Please tell me how often you have felt this way during the past week:*
1. I was bothered by things that usually don't bother me.  
2. I did not feel like eating; my appetite was poor.  
3. I felt that I could not shake off the blues even with help from my family or friends.  
4. I felt that I was just as good as other people.  
5. I had trouble keeping my mind on what I was doing.  
6. I felt depressed.  
7. I felt that everything I did was an effort.  
8. I felt hopeful about the future.  
9. I thought my life had been a failure.  
10. I felt fearful.  
11. My sleep was restless.  
12. I was happy.  
13. I talked less than usual.  
14. I felt lonely.  
15. People were unfriendly.  
16. I enjoyed life.  
17. I had crying spells.  
18. I felt sad.  
19. I felt that people dislike me.  
20. I could not get "going".

**Harmonization comment**:  The CES-D 20 depression scores (0-60) in LASA were grouped into study-specific tertiles defined as low (0-3), medium (4-9), and high (10-60).

If 1 or more items were missing, scores on the completed items were summed and divided by the number of items completed, then multiplied by 20. If participants missed 5 or more items, scores were not calculated and coded as missing.

**Harmonization status**: complete   
**Harmonization comment**:  The De-Jong Gierveld Loneliness scores (11-33) in LASA were grouped into study-specific tertiles defined as low (11), medium (12-14), and high (15-33). Scores were calculated for participants with data on at least 9 items (out of a possible 11).If 1 or more items were missing, scores on the completed items were summed and divided by the number of items completed and multiplied by 11. If participants missed 3 or more items, scores were not calculated and coded as missing. Items comprising the *De Jong-Gierveld Loneliness Scale, 11 item version*, are listed below:  
1. There is always someone I can talk to about my day to day problems.  
2. I miss having a really close friend.  
3. I experience a general sense of emptiness.
4. There are plenty of people I can lean on when I have problems.  
5. I miss the pleasure of the company of others.  
6. I find my circle of friends and acquaintances too limited.  
7. There are many people I can trust completely.
8. There are enough people I feel close to.
9. I miss having people around.
10. I often feel rejected.  
11. I can call on my friends whenever I need them.  
Responses ranged from 'no' (1), 'more or less' (2) to 'yes' (3).  

**R script**:

2 | High levels of loneliness

**Harmonization status**: complete   
**Harmonization comment**:  The De-Jong Gierveld Loneliness scores (11-33) in LASA were grouped into study-specific tertiles defined as low (11), medium (12-14), and high (15-33). Scores were calculated for participants with data on at least 9 items (out of a possible 11).If 1 or more items were missing, scores on the completed items were summed and divided by the number of items completed and multiplied by 11. If participants missed 3 or more items, scores were not calculated and coded as missing.       
**R script**:  
Responses for items 2-3, 5-6, and 9-10 were kept as is.

**Harmonization status**: complete   
**Harmonization comment**:  The SRIP post-traumatic stress disorder scores (22-88) were calculated for LASA participants with data on at least 18 items (out of a possible 22). If 1 or more items were missing, scores on the completed items were summed and divided by the number of items completed, then multipled by 22. If participants missed 5 or more items, scores were not calculated and coded as missing. Participants with SRIP scores of 39 and higher were classified as cases, as per the scale-specific cut-off (van Zelst, de Beurs, Beekman et al 2003). Items comprising the *Self-Rating Inventory for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (SRIP) scale* are listed below:    
1. Feeling of being estranged from others
2. Feeling of being detached from others
3. Feeling of having no future
4. Difficulty expressing emotions
5. Difficulty concentrating
6. Feeling irritable
7. Being easily frightened
8.Diminished interest in important activities
9. Amnesia for events from the past
10. Feeling that events from the past were happening again
11. Acting as if events from the past were happening again
12. Having dreary dreams
13. Having recurrent unpleasant memories
14. Having intrusive unpleasant memories
15. Having bursts of anger
16. Being vigilant
17. Trying to avoid thoughts about past events
18. Trying to avoid feelings about past events
19. Trying to avoid situations that would recall past events
20. Physical reactions with recalling past events
21. Having problems sleeping through 
22. Having problems sleeping in  
Response categories ranged from 'not at all' (1), 'somewhat' (2), 'considerably' (3) to 'very much' (4).

Items comprising the *Mental Health Inventory, 2 item version, (MHI-2)* scale are listed below:  
1. Have you felt calm and peaceful?
2. Have you felt downhearted and blue?
Responses ranged from 'all of the time' (1), 'most of the time' (2), 'a good bit of the time' (3), 'some of the time' (4), 'a little of the time' (5), and 'none of the time' (6).

```{r, echo=TRUE}
mho_LASA1_3$psy_qol_low_3 <- as.integer(car::recode(LASA1E$eqvall_i, "24:60=0; 12:23=1")) 

```
